# A Twitch guide for the Dutch

Twitch has been growing a lot lately in the Netherlands, so this also means that a lot of new people will join Twitch as well. This website is meant for those new people. I want them to have a closer look at how Twitch works and how to chat. 


### Main purpose
I want people to get used to chat and all the features that Twitch has. This includes the following and much more:
- Emotes and basic behaivour in chat
- Cheering and donations
- Twitch turbo and prime
- Difference between subscribing and following
- All chat icons
- Channel browsing and discover
- Friends system
